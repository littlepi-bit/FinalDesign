13. Which subjects do you like best?
> Computer graphics is my favourite subject, because this course is very interesting, and it shows the principles of many movie and game implementations.

## 项目介绍
### 分布式缓存项目
#### 简介
模仿groupcache的实现，支持：
1. 单机缓存和基于HTTP的分布式缓存
2. 采用LRU（Least Recently Used，最近最少访问）缓存淘汰机制
3. 使用Go锁机制防止缓存击穿
4. 使用一致性哈希选择节点，实现负载均衡


#### 运行流程
```
                是
接收 key --> 检查是否被缓存 -----> 返回缓存值 ⑴
                |  否                         是
                |-----> 是否应当从远程节点获取 -----> 与远程节点交互 --> 返回缓存值 ⑵
                            |  否
                            |-----> 调用`回调函数`，获取值并添加到缓存 --> 返回缓存值 ⑶
```

#### LRU缓存淘汰策略
LRU认为，如果数据最近被访问过，那么将来被访问的概率也会更高。
##### 数据结构
LRU算法的核心数据结构有一个hash字典和一个双向链表组成。
- 字典存储键和值的映射关系，通过键值映射到双向链表的结点。
- 双向链表实现缓存值队列，当访问到某个值时，将其移动到队列尾部。当缓存数量超过队列容量时，删除队列头部的记录。

#### 分布式结点负载均衡
使用一致性哈希算法解决分布式缓存选择节点的问题
- 使用哈希计算，对于给定的key值，每次都选择同一个结点
- 一致性哈希算法将key值映射到其值域范围的空间上，将数字首位相连，形成一个环。将结点的哈希值放置在环上；计算key的哈希值，在环上顺时针寻找第一个结点，就是所要选取的结点。
- 一致性哈希算法可以解决结点故障时的缓存雪崩问题。
- 对于数据倾斜问题，可以增加虚拟节点，将选择的虚拟节点映射到真实节点。

#### 使用Go锁机制防止缓存击穿
- 对于相同的key值，向节点发起多次相同的请求，会增加数据库的负担。
- 因此，对于第一次key值的请求，利用Go的waitgroup锁机制，在发起请求前加锁，实际增加等待队列数量。如果存在相同请求，则阻塞该请求，直到锁被释放。
- 当锁释放时，对于阻塞的请求，都可以返回相同的缓存值，不必再向数据库发起请求，防止了缓存击穿的发生。
